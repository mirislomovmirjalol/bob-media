      BOB Media (Back of the Brain) is an Independent Production Company Making Feature Films, Documentaries And Event
      Promotional videos.

      BOB Media is run by Bruce Edgar and a host team of filmmaking associates, it is one of the UKâ€™s most innovative
      newcomer production companies. We craft visually appealing, fresh projects that conceptualise true stories,
      complex visions, expectations and past experiences into ideas and production all the way from the back of the
      brain.

      Our current production schedule includes several short form documentaries and a feature film, set in a Dystopian
      near future, with the working title 'Interbeing' (A wealthy revolutionary activist with a troubled past is subject
      to a brutal attack from government agencies. Forced to take action, his response changes the course of history).
      We also regularly help our clients to advertise their events with shorter length promotional videos.

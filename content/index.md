    Our current production schedule includes several short form documentaries and a feature film, set in a Dystopian near future, with the working title 'Interbeing' (A wealthy revolutionary activist with a troubled past is subject to a brutal attack from government agencies. Forced to take action, his response changes the course of history). We also regularly help our clients to advertise their events with shorter length promotional videos.
